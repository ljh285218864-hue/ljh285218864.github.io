        <p>
          Taoist Destiny Studio grew out of a simple wish: to offer clear, grounded readings that respect both
          ancient Chinese wisdom and modern life. Instead of promising guaranteed outcomes, we focus on timing,
          tendencies, and how you can adjust your own actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The readings draw on concepts such as yin and yang, seasonal rhythm, and the movement of qi. 
          Some structures may reference traditional Chinese destiny frameworks, but all messages are explained
          in plain, modern English.

      Alongside readings, some people choose simple symbolic rituals — such as lighting a candle, keeping a talisman, 
      or making a small offering — to anchor their intention in daily life.

          Rituals here are designed to be simple and respectful: a short focus, a clear intention, and a small, tangible action.
          They are not meant to “force” outcomes, but to remind you of the direction you have consciously chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might choose to keep a written intention on your desk, light incense on specific days, 
          or wear a small talisman as a reminder of your reading.

    <div class="faq-list">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>1. Is this a prediction that cannot be changed?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Readings describe tendencies, timing, and patterns. Your choices, actions, and support from
          professionals still matter more than any reading.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>2. What information do you need?</h3>
        <p>
          Usually: your name or nickname, date of birth, and one main question in English.
          If a specific method needs more details, this will be explained clearly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>3. How accurate is a reading?</h3>
        <p>
          A reading is not a guarantee. It is a mirror that can highlight patterns and timing,
          but real life will always be more complex than words on a page.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>4. Is this a replacement for therapy, doctors, or lawyers?</h3>
        <p>
          No. If you are facing serious health, legal, or mental health issues, 
          please seek licensed professionals or local emergency services first.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>5. Can I ask follow-up questions?</h3>
        <p>
          Short clarifications may be possible. Larger or new topics are usually better handled
          through a separate reading to keep the work focused.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>6. In what language are readings delivered?</h3>
        <p>
          All written readings are delivered in English. You are welcome to translate them into your own language for personal use.
