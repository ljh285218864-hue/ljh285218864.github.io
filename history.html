    <p class="section-intro">
      Taoism (or Daoism) is a broad family of Chinese traditions that grew over many centuries.
      It includes classic philosophical texts, temple rituals, internal practices, and local customs.
      The common thread is an interest in living in harmony with the <em>Tao</em> – 
      a word that can be translated as “the Way”.

    <div class="section-title">The Way, yin–yang, and timing</div>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Although Taoist history is complex, a few recurring themes are especially relevant 
      for destiny readings and Feng Shui-style work:

        <div class="card-meta">Tao</div>
        <h3>The Way</h3>
        <p>
          The Tao is often described as the natural, underlying pattern of how things move and change.
          It is not a person or a fixed rulebook, but a flowing order that humans can either work with or against.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <div class="card-meta">Yin · Yang</div>
        <h3>Balance of forces</h3>
        <p>
          Yin and yang are complementary qualities – such as soft and firm, dark and light, inner and outer.
          Taoist thinking looks at how these qualities alternate and balance, instead of trying to make one side
          completely “win”.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <div class="card-meta">Timing</div>
        <h3>Right action at the right time</h3>
        <p>
          Many Taoist stories describe people acting in harmony with timing: pushing gently when it is time to advance,
          and stepping back when it is time to rest or wait. Destiny readings often focus on this sense of timing.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <div class="card-meta">Wu wei</div>
        <h3>Effort that does not fight itself</h3>
        <p>
          “Wu wei” is sometimes translated as “non-doing”, but it really points to action that is not forced or frantic.
          It is effort that follows the grain of the situation, instead of constantly pushing against it.

  <section class="section">
    <div class="section-heading">Destiny</div>
    <div class="section-title">Destiny as pattern, not prison</div>
    <p class="section-intro">
      In Chinese traditions, “destiny” can be understood as a mixture of what you are born with 
      (temperament, tendencies, timing) and how you respond to circumstances over time.
      From a Taoist-inspired perspective, a reading does not lock you into a fixed script.
      Instead, it highlights patterns so you can choose how to walk with them.

    <div class="section-heading">How this site uses Taoist ideas</div>
    <div class="section-title">Gentle influence, not absolute authority</div>
    <p class="section-intro">
      The services on this site are inspired by Taoist views of timing, pattern, and balance,
      but they are not formal religious rituals and do not claim absolute accuracy.
      Any references to Taoist history are used as gentle background, not as a promise that
      one reading can fully define your life.
