    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>Taoist Destiny Studio is a small project inspired by Chinese Taoist thought and traditional destiny reading frameworks.</p>
    <p>Our focus is not on superstition, but on creating gentle tools that help you pause, reflect, and realign with what feels true for you.</p>

    <h2>A brief note on Chinese Taoist culture</h2>
    <p>Taoism (Daoism) is a Chinese philosophical and spiritual tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao—the underlying natural way or flow of reality.</p>
    <p>Key ideas include balance between yin and yang, the movement of qi (vital energy), and the importance of aligning with natural cycles rather than forcing outcomes.</p>
    <p>Over centuries, Taoism has influenced Chinese views on health, timing, home arrangement, and personal cultivation.</p>

  <div class="info-block">
    <h2>How this influences our products and readings</h2>
    <p>• Feng Shui decor pieces are designed as symbols of flow, balance, and attention to space.</p>
    <p>• Wearable jewelry is meant to act as a personal reminder of a chosen intention, not as a magic object.</p>
    <p>• Readings draw from traditional ideas about time cycles and personal tendencies, but are explained in clear, modern English.</p>

    <p>They do not replace professional advice from doctors, therapists, lawyers, or financial advisors.</p>
