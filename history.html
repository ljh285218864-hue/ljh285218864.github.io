    <p class="page-intro">
      This studio takes inspiration from key Taoist ideas: the living nature of the Tao,
      the movement of yin and yang, and the importance of timing and sincerity.
      It is not an academic presentation, but a working background.

      <h2 class="page-section-title">The Tao as a moving path</h2>
      <p class="page-section-text">
        Rather than a fixed destination, the Tao is often described as a path that
        continues to move. Readings are written with this in mind: not as “final answers”,
        but as glimpses of your current stretch of road.

      <h2 class="page-section-title">Yin and yang as dynamic balance</h2>
      <p class="page-section-text">
        Yin and yang are not “good” and “bad”, but complementary movements. Career and
        rest, speaking and listening, solitude and connection – these are read as
        balancing forces, not enemies.

      <h2 class="page-section-title">Sincerity and timing</h2>
      <p class="page-section-text">
        Taoist tradition often emphasizes that both sincerity of heart and timing in the
        outer world matter. The studio pays attention to how your questions arise inside
        wider cycles, without claiming to control them.
