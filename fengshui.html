        We look at basic directions, light, and where your bed is placed in relation
        to doors and windows. Adjustments are suggested with respect for your existing
        furniture and constraints.

        Small changes to where you sit, what you face, and how symbolic items are placed
        can shift the feeling of your working hours, especially if you spend many hours

        For those who wish to maintain a small altar, suggestions focus on proportion,
        simplicity, and the emotional meaning of each object rather than complexity.
