    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p>Answers to the most common questions before you place an order.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="info-block">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>1. What information do you need for a reading?</h3>
      <p>For most readings, you will be asked for your name or nickname, your date of birth, and your main question.</p>
      <p>If a specific method requires more details, that will be clearly explained before you confirm your order.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>2. How long does it take to receive my reading?</h3>
      <p>Most readings are delivered within 3–5 working days after we receive your details and question.</p>
      <p>During busy periods or holidays, delivery may take a little longer, but we will inform you if that happens.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>3. In what format will I receive the reading?</h3>
      <p>You will receive your reading as a written text in English, which can be sent by email or a messaging platform, depending on your preference.</p>
      <p>Written format allows you to re-read and reflect at your own pace.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>4. Do readings or products guarantee results?</h3>
      <p>No. Both readings and products are tools for reflection and intention-setting.</p>
      <p>Real change depends on your decisions, actions, and support from appropriate professionals where needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>5. Can I ask follow-up questions after a reading?</h3>
      <p>Short clarifications may be possible, but extensive follow-up is usually handled through a new reading request.</p>
      <p>This keeps the process clear and fair for both sides.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>6. Are there any situations where I should not rely on a reading?</h3>
      <p>Yes. If you are facing a crisis related to physical or mental health, legal trouble, or serious financial risk, please contact qualified professionals or local emergency services first.</p>
      <p>Readings are not a replacement for urgent or professional help.</p>
